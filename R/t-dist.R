## t- distribution -----------
# One method for inference on numerical data is simulations 
# When the parameter of interest is the mean or a difference two means and certain 
# Is possoble used the method bases on the central limit theorem for conducting inference


# The t- distribution is used when the sample mean population, sd and sigma is unknown
# t- distribution is bell shaped but has thiucker tails the normal.
# In t distribution  the observations more likely to fall beyond 2 sd from the mean 
# t distribution allways centered at cero
# has one parameter : degrees of freedom - deerminates thickness of tails 
# When incrememnt degrees of freedom then t-dist is most similar to normal distribution
